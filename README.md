# The Gates Of Moria

An adventure in learning Ruby!

## Installation

You'll need Ruby 1.9.3 to play the game. See what version of Ruby you have by running

    ruby --version
    
If it doesn't say something like "ruby 1.9.3" at the beginning, then should follow the instructions at https://rvm.io/ to install RVM and then install Ruby 1.9.3 with it.

Now, you can install the gem to your global gemset with:

    $ gem install gates_of_moria

Or if you are using Bundler and want to put it in a Gemfile, addd this line to your Gemfile:

    gem 'gates_of_moria'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Run `gates_of_moria` and follow the on-screen instructions. Enjoy!
